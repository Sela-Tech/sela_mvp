# Sela React Client
This document intends to clarify the design and inner workings of the React webapp. But first things first...
## How to run
While at the root of the repository:
`npm i` 
...
`cd client && npm i && cd ..`
At this point you've installed all the project dependencies and you are back at the root, ready to run:
`npm start`
That's it. The Express server should now be running along with the webpackDevServer. You can visit the app at localhost:3001/client (Your browser has probably automatically opened a new tab at localhost:3000 which also serves the app... Use either.).
