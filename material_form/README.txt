 I've created `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `checkbox` and `radio` fields in the material style, without Javascript. Even the button has a nice ripple effect. 
How to detect if there is some value in a input or a textarea? For that, I used the `:valid` selector. If the field is required and has no value, the styles didn't get applied, but if it has a value, the field gets valid and the styles get applied.
